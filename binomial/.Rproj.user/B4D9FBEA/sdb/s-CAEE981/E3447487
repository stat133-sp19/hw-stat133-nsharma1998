The data frame has two classes: 'bindis' and 'data.frame'.\n\nBelow are examples of how to use the function:\n\n```{r}\n#Probability distribution of binomial with 5 trials and p=0.5\nbin_distribution(5, 0.5)\n\n#Probability distribution of binomial with 2 trials and p=0.2\nbin_distribution(2, 0.2)\n```\n\n\nThis function can also be used in conjunction with plot.bindis, which plots the distribution of the resulting bindis object.\n\n```{r}\n# plotting binomial probability distribution with n=5, p=0.5\ndis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)\nplot(dis1)\n```\n\n\n## Function- bin_cumulative()\n\nThe next step is the function bin_cumulative, which calculates the entire cumulative distribution for the binomial given a number of trials and a specific probability of success and returns a data frame with the appropiate information. The data frame has two classes: 'bincum' and 'data.frame'.\n\n```{r}\n# binomial cumulative distribution with n=5, p=0.5\nbin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\nThis function can also be used in conjunction with plot.bindis, which plots the resulting bindis object.\n\n```{r}\n# plotting binomial cumulative distribution with n=5, p=0.5\ndis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)\nplot(dis2)\n```\n\n##Function bin_variable()\n\nThe function `bin_variable()` returns a list (of class \"binvar\") with the attributes of the binomial distribution. It takes in the number of trials and the probability of success as arguments. \n\nBelow is an example of how to use bin_variable()\n\n```{r}\nbin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)\nbin1\n```\n\nThis function can be used in conjunction with summary.binvar(), which takes in a binvar object and returns a summary of the random variable. \n\n```{r}\nsummary(bin1)\n```\n\n## Functions of measures\n\nFinally, there are five functions which allow you to view features of the binomial distribution. These features are the mean, mode, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. These functions all take in number of trials and probability as an argument. \n\nBelow are examples of how to use the functions.\n```{r}\n#N=10, p=0.3\nbin_mean(10, 0.3)\nbin_variance(10, 0.3)\nbin_mode(10, 0.3)\nbin_skewness(10, 0.3)\nbin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)\n```\n\n",
